## In-Vehicle Network 

## CAN Protocol
### CAN Pros
* Low cost
* Network multiple microcontrollers with 1 pair of wires support high speed data transfer 
* Efficient
* Reliable Means There are five mechanisms for detecting errors in the CAN protocol:
  1) Bit monitoring
  2) Bit stuffing
  3) Frame check
  4) Acknowledgment check
  5) Cyclic redundancy check
* ROBUST: High speed data lines are resistant to Electromagnetic interface and electrical disturbances
